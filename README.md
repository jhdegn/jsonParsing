# jsonParsing

Goal:
Please write some JavaScript that when executed in the browser will take any arbitrary json string document body and convert it to structured html on the page.
The idea being that your code would be able to parse and structure any string that is in json format, not just one particular example.

Repository Introduction:
I started off with the psuedoCode file and brokedown the problem, listing certain things that needed to be addressed.  Then I took that list and mapped out what the steps would be for writing a javaScript file that would accomplish our goal.
I do not have much experience with javaScript or html, so I wasn't able to go into great detail, but instead put together the logical approach I would use. 

After mapping it out, I spent some time learning more about html and javaScript so that I could try to implement a few of the steps.  I learned a lot but didn't have an implementation for each step.
Regardless, I put my attempts in the partial.js file, where the attempts are labeled for which step they correspond to. 

Also in the repository are two sample json files that I put together in order to test it out a little bit.
